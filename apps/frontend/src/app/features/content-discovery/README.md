# Content Discovery Feature

This folder contains the initial scaffold for Phase 6: Content Discovery.

Files:
- `content-discovery.module.ts` — Angular module for the feature
- `content-discovery.component.ts/.html/.css` — Basic discovery UI (filters + search)
- `discovery-filter.service.ts` — Stubbed service to drive the UI during development

Next steps:
- Integrate with `MatchesService` to fetch real data
- Implement `search.component` with autocomplete and debounce
- Add advanced filters and UX polish
- Add unit tests and E2E flows
