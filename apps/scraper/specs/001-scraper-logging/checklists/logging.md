# Logging & Diagnostics Checklist: Scraper Logging Recovery

**Purpose**: Validate completeness and clarity of logging and diagnostic requirements (FR-001, FR-002) before planning
**Created**: 2025-11-05
**Feature**: specs/001-scraper-logging/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are structured logging requirements enumerated for every scraper stage (navigation, DOM evaluation, extraction, validation, persistence, external API touchpoints) with no gaps? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK002 Does the spec define mandatory metadata fields each log entry must include (timestamp, severity, correlation ID, contextual payload) so implementers know the schema? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK003 Are diagnostic artifact capture triggers documented for both DOM validation failures and unhandled exceptions, including how partial data is preserved? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is "structured log entry" defined with expected format or serialization guidance (e.g., JSON keys) to prevent interpretation drift? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK005 Are storage location and retention expectations for diagnostic artifacts stated explicitly to avoid ambiguity? [Clarity, Gap]
- [ ] CHK006 Does the spec clarify how correlation identifiers are generated and propagated across log events and artifacts? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 4]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK007 Do requirements cover logging for both successful and failed navigation attempts, including retries and timeout outcomes? [Scenario Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK008 Are DOM drift scenarios (missing selectors, tolerance breaches) paired with explicit logging content and remediation guidance? [Scenario Coverage, Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK009 Does the spec differentiate logging behavior between standard runs and debug mode so diagnostic verbosity expectations are clear? [Scenario Coverage, Spec §User Story 5]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK010 Are anti-bot or challenge page responses required to generate detailed logs capturing response type and mitigation attempts? [Edge Case Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK011 Are mid-cycle network interruptions mandated to emit partial-run diagnostics before shutdown to preserve context? [Edge Case Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional & Operational Readiness

- [ ] CHK012 Is log volume management (rotation limits, throttling) defined so observability improvements do not introduce operational risk? [Non-Functional, Spec §Risks & Mitigations]
- [ ] CHK013 Does the spec require safeguards for sensitive data within captured diagnostics to satisfy governance policies? [Non-Functional, Spec §Risks & Mitigations]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK014 Are dependencies on log storage or centralized aggregation documented with capacity and availability expectations? [Dependencies & Assumptions, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK015 Is the assumption that operators can access aggregated logs explicitly validated or flagged for follow-up? [Dependencies & Assumptions, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK016 Is potential tension between debug-mode artifact retention and data governance policies resolved with clear guidance? [Ambiguity, Spec §Risks & Mitigations]
