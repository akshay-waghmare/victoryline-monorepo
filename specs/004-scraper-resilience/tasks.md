  -- Metrics available on :9090 and scrapeable by Prometheus; unit test verifies metrics endpoint

T302 [US3] Create Prometheus scrape config `monitoring/prometheus.yml` and docker-compose monitoring stack (48h retention for tiny profile) — S
  -- Prometheus scrapes scraper:9090 and backend:8080; local compose brings up monitoring stack (Grafana optional for tiny); scrape interval 15s standard / 30s tiny

T303 [US3] Implement Grafana dashboards (`monitoring/grafana/dashboards/`) including RSS per-scraper and data freshness (optional for tiny profile) — M

T404 [US4] Add lifecycle watchdog that enforces Docker memory policy and reports when host low memory prevents new scrapers from starting — S
  -- Host refuses new scraper starts when available memory <500MB and queues start request

T405 [US4] Load test: 10 concurrent scrapers for 12 hours (standard) or 2 scrapers for 6-8 hours (tiny) in staging and record KPIs — L
  -- Standard: Memory per-scraper <1GB avg, total <10GB, no monotonic growth; Tiny: Memory per-scraper <700MB avg, total <2GB, system free RAM >1GB; runbook for failures documented

---

Goal: Adjust scraper behavior dynamically based on observed conditions.

T501 [US5] Implement `AdaptivePoller` in `crex_scraper_python/adaptive.py` (adjust intervals and timeouts per profile) — M
  -- Behavior matches acceptance scenarios: Standard (2s/2.5s/5s/10s/20s/30s) or Tiny (3s/5s/10s/20s/30s) according to recent error/change rates

T502 [US5] Add logic to increase timeouts by 50% under high-latency observations and decrease when stable — M
  -- Page timeout adapts from 30s → 45s and back; tests simulate latency profiles

T503 [US5] Implement priority-based allocation for high-priority matches (increase poll frequency) — M
  -- High-priority matches get more resources and higher polling frequency; documented config

---

## Estimates & Priorities (summary)

- Critical path (Phase 2 Foundational + US1 + US2): ~3-4 weeks (with 2 engineers)  
- Full feature rollout with optimizations (Phases 3-6): ~8 weeks total as described in plan.md
- **Tiny Profile**: Skip or defer Phase 6 optimization tasks; focus on Phases 1-5 (~6 weeks)

## Deployment Profile Selection

**Standard Profile (8GB+ RAM)**:
- All tasks apply as written
- Target: 10+ concurrent scrapers
- Full monitoring stack: Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager

**Tiny Profile (4GB RAM VPS)**:
- Additional tasks: T707-T711 (Chromium optimization, docker-compose.tiny.yml, zram, docs)
- Modified tasks: T003, T010, T104, T202, T302, T303, T305, T405, T501 (see adjustments above)
- Target: 1-2 concurrent scrapers maximum
- Lightweight monitoring: Prometheus + Alertmanager (Grafana optional)
- Phased deployment: 1 scraper (Week 1) → 2 scrapers if stable (Week 2) → monitoring (Week 3)

## How to use

**Standard Profile**:
1. Start with Foundational tasks (T005..T015). These block all user story work.  
2. Parallelize US1 and US2 tasks after foundational completion.  
3. Run T705 to wire acceptance tests into CI and gate merges.  
4. Use T401/T405 load tests and dashboards (T702) to tune memory/disk/container limits.

**Tiny Profile**:
1. Complete T001-T004 with docker-compose.tiny.yml (T708)
2. Add Chromium optimization flags (T707) before Foundational tasks
3. Complete Foundational tasks (T005..T015) with tiny profile batch sizes
4. Implement US1 and US2 with adjusted memory thresholds
5. Deploy single scraper first (Week 1), validate 24h stability before scaling to 2
6. Monitor system free RAM; if consistently <1GB, remain at 1 scraper
7. Skip or defer US5 (Adaptive Performance) and Phase 6 (Optimization) initially
