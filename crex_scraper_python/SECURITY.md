# Security Policy for the Project

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please send an email to [your-email@example.com]. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Security Best Practices

To help maintain the security of this project, please adhere to the following best practices:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly check for updates to dependencies and apply them as necessary. Use tools like Dependabot to automate this process.

2. **Use Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information such as API keys and database credentials in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in the source code.

3. **Implement Proper Authentication**: Ensure that all endpoints requiring authentication are secured and that sensitive data is not exposed.

4. **Validate Input**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.

5. **Monitor for Vulnerabilities**: Use tools to scan your code and dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

6. **Limit Access**: Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to resources and services.

7. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and mitigate potential security risks.

By following these guidelines, we can work together to keep this project secure.
